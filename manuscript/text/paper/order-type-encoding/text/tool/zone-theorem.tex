The zone theorem\fi}

The zone of a given pseudoline of an arrangement is the set of cells of the
arrangement supported by that pseudoline.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:a-zone-in-the-plane} illustrates a zone in a two-dimensional
arrangement of lines.

    arrangement of the plain lines is emphasized in light grey.%
  }\label{fig:a-zone-in-the-plane}
\end{figure}

We define the complexity of each cell to be the number of its sides.
We define the complexity of a zone to be the sum of the complexities of its cells.
%
The Zone Theorem states that the complexity of any zone is linear.

%This result is important because it allows optimal
%incremental construction of arrangements of line arrangements, a frequently
%used tool.

In~\cite{EOS86} and in the first edition of~\cite{Ed12}, there were claims of
generalization of this result to arrangements of hyperplanes in higher
dimension.
%
However, the proofs turned out to be flawed~\cite{ESS93}.
%
Edelsbrunner, Sturmfels, and Sharir were the first to provide a valid proof of
the generalized result~\cite{ESS93}.
%

%They also cite valid proofs by Houle and Matou{\v s}ek for a weaker version of the
%theorem:
%
%The Zone Theorem bounds the sum of complexities of the cells in a zone.
%
%The full generalization of the theorem defines the complexity of each cell to
%be the number of all \(0\)-faces, \(1\)-faces, \dots, and (\(d-1\))-faces
%supporting the cell.
%
%The weak generalization only counts (\(d-1\))-faces.
%
%However, no publication of those proofs is known to the authors.
