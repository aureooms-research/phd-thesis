\begin{theorem}[Zone Theorem in the plane~\cite{BEPY90}]\label{thm:zone-theorem-2}
Given an arrangement of \(n+1\) pseudolines,
%
%in \(\mathbb{R}^2\),
%
the sum of the numbers of sides
%
in all the cells supported by one of the pseudolines
%
is at most \(\lfloor 9.5 n \rfloor - 1\).%
\footnote{%
Note that an earlier weaker (worse constant factor) linear bound is implied by
a theorem in~\cite{CGL85}.%
}
\end{theorem}
