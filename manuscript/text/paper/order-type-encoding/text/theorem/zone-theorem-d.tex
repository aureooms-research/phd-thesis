\begin{theorem}[Zone Theorem~\cite{ESS93}]\label{thm:zone-theorem-d}
Given an arrangement of \(n\) hyperplanes
%
in \(\mathbb{R}^d\),
%
the sum of the numbers of \(0\)-faces, \(1\)-faces, \dots, and (\(d-1\))-faces
%
in all the cells supported by one of the hyperplanes
%
is \(O(n^{d-1})\).
\end{theorem}
