\begin{theorem}\label{thm:preprocessing-d}
  In the real-RAM model and the constant-degree algebraic decision tree model,
  given \(n\) real-coordinate input points in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) we can compute
  the encoding of their chirotope as in Theorem~\ref{thm:realizable-d} in \(
  O(n^{d}) \) time.
\end{theorem}
