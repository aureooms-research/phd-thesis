\section{Meiser Solves \(k\)-SUM}

The results in this section have been published in Paper A.
Our main contribution in this paper is an efficient implementation of an
existing algorithm by Meiser~\cite{M93} when applied to the \(k\)-SUM problem.

This section is divided into three subsections:
Subsection~\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm:contrib:query-complexity} gives the outline of the
algorithm and analyses its complexity in the linear decision tree model.
Subsection~\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm:contrib:time-complexity} gives a second
slightly more complex implementation and analysis of this algorithm in the word-RAM
model. Subsection~\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm:contrib:query-size} gives a simple
tweak that can be applied to those algorithms in order to reduce the complexity
of the queries involved.

Additional details are found in the remaining sections.
