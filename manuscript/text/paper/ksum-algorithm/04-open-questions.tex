\section{Open Questions}

There are a few interesting questions that are left unanswered:

The best linear decision tree for \(k\)-SUM has depth \(O_k(n \log^2 n)\) while
the lower bound is \(\Omega_k(n \log n)\).
Can we match the information theoretic lower bound for \(k\)-SUM with linear
decision trees, that is,
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a \(O_k(n \log n)\)-depth LDT for \(k\)-SUM?
\end{openquestion}

The same question can be asked about the point location problem. The best
linear decision tree for arbitrary hyperplanes has depth \(O(d^2 \log m)\) and
the lower bound is \(\Omega(d \log m)\).
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a \(O(d \log m)\)-depth LDT for point location?
\end{openquestion}

We showed how to efficiently implement Meiser's algorithm in the word-RAM model
when applied to \(k\)-SUM. However, we did not manage to get the query
complexity down to the current state of the art.
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a word-RAM algorithm for \(k\)-SUM using \(n^{3 - \Omega(1)}\)
linear queries and running in time \(n^{\frac{k}{2}+O(1)}\)?
\end{openquestion}

We also have not managed to match the running time of the best known uniform
algorithm.
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a word-RAM algorithm for \(k\)-SUM using \(n^{o(k)}\) linear queries and
running in time \( \tilde{O}(n^{\lceil \frac k2 \rceil})\)?
\end{openquestion}

Gr\o nlund and Pettie~\cite{GP18}
showed how to solve 3SUM in slightly subquadratic time in the real-RAM model.
However, so far, their technique and its subsequent
improvements~\cite{Fr15,GS15,Ch18}, have failed to generalize to uniform algorithms
for \(k\)-SUM.
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(o(n^{\lceil \frac k2 \rceil})\)-time real-RAM algorithm for
	\(k\)-SUM with \(k \geq 4\)?
\end{openquestion}
