\section{Open Questions}

Can we achieve \(O(n \log n)\) queries for k-SUM, shaving the last
\(\log{}\)?

Can we design a uniform algorithm that uses \(O(n^{1+ \varepsilon})\) queries and runs
in time \(n^{\frac{k}{2}+O(1)}\)?

Can we achieve \(O(n^{\lceil \frac k2 \rceil})\) time and \(n^{O(1)}\) queries?

Can we achieve \(o(n^{\lceil \frac k2 \rceil})\) time for \(k \geq 4\)? GP
showed how to do it for \(k = 3\).
