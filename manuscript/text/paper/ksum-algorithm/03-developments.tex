\section{Even Better Nonuniform Algorithms}

\subsection{Using Vertical Decomposition}

Ezra and
Sharir~\cite{ES17}
later improved the decision tree depth to \( O(n^2 \log n) \) by using
vertical decomposition instead.

\subsection{Inference Dimension}

In a breakthrough result, Kane, Lovett, and Moran~\cite{KLM18} proved
that $k$-SUM can be solved using $O(n \log^2 n)$ $2k$-linear queries. This is
close to the information theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(n \log n)$. Their
decision tree is also a prune and search algorithm.
