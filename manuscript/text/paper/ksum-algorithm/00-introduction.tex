\chapter{Sorting}

QUOTE ``Please, pretty please, order those data from smallest to largest''.

The sorting problem is one of the oldest and most practical data management
problems.
%
Usually, sorting is about permutations in \emph{arrays}, but we do not like
that. We use a different abstraction:

\input{text/definition/sorting}

\section{Algorithms}
Explain models of computation: uniform nonuniform etc

\section{Data Structures}

Most (if not all) algorithms for sorting receive their input data as a list and
output their answer as a permutation of this data. This permutation is a
compact data structure: the structure takes space proportional to the minimum
amount of space possible (about \(\log_2 n!\)), and the answer to each
comparison can be retrieved instantly from the structure.

\chapter{The \(k\)-SUM Problem}

The \(k\)-SUM problem is simple enough: given a list of \(n\) real numbers,
decide whether \(k\) of them sum to zero.

\input{text/definition/ksum}

For fixed \(k\), the \(k\)-SUM problem can be solved in polynomial time
\(O(n^k)\) by testing all possible candidate solutions.
The interesting question is whether it is possible to improve on
this brute-force solution.
