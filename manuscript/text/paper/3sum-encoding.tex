\chapter{Encoding 3SUM}

We consider the following problem: given three sets of real numbers, output a
word-RAM data structure from which we can efficiently recover the sign of the
sum of any triple of numbers, one in each set.

This is similar to a previous work by some of
the authors to encode the order type of a finite set of points. While this previous
work showed that it was possible to achieve slightly subquadratic space and
logarithmic query time, we show here that for the simpler 3SUM problem, one
can achieve an encoding that takes \(\tilde{O}(N^{\frac 32})\) space for inputs sets
of size \(N\) and allows constant time queries in the word-RAM.
