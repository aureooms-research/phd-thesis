\section{Models of Computation}

Similarly to Gr\o nlund and Pettie~\cite{GP18}, we consider both nonuniform
and uniform models of computation.
%
For the nonuniform model, Gr\o nlund and Pettie consider linear
decision trees, where one is only allowed to manipulate the input numbers
through linear queries to an oracle. Each linear query has constant cost and
all other operations are free but cannot inspect the input.
%
In this paper, we consider
\emph{bounded-degree algebraic decision trees (ADT)}~\cite{R72,Y81,SY82},
an algebraic generalization of linear decision trees,
as the nonuniform model. In a bounded-degree algebraic decision tree, one
performs constant cost branching operations that amount to test the sign of
a constant-degree polynomial of the input numbers. Again,
operations not involving the input are free.
%
For the uniform model we consider the real-RAM model with only the four
arithmetic operators.
