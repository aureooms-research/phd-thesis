\section{Applications}\label{sec:applications}

To illustrate the expressive power of 3POL, we give some geometric
applications in the sections that follow. We show the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\item GPT can be solved in subquadratic time provided the input points
lie on few parameterized constant-degree polynomial curves.
\item In the plane, given three sets $C_i$ of $n$ unit circles and three points
$p_i$ such that a circle $c \in C_i$ contains $p_i$, deciding whether there
exists $(a,b,c) \in C_1 \times C_2 \times C_3$ such that $a \cap b \cap c
\neq \emptyset$ can be done in subquadratic time.
\item Given $n$ input points in the plane, deciding whether any triple spans a unit
triangle can be done in subquadratic time, provided the input points lie on few
parameterized constant-degree polynomial curves.
\end{enumerate}
