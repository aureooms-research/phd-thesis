\section{Timothy Chan Strikes Again}

In 2017, Timothy Chan presented a
\(O((n^2 / \log^2 n)(\log \log n)^{O(1)})\)-time real-RAM algorithm for
3SUM~\cite{Ch18}, shaving a logarithmic factor from previous solutions~\cite{Fr15,GS15}.

His technique relies on cuttings in near-logarithmic dimension on an augmented
real-RAM model with constant time nonstandard operations on $\Theta(\log n)$
bits words. Cuttings essentially replace dominance reporting in Gr\o nlund and
Pettie's algorithm~\cite{GP18}.
This is inspired by another one of his papers on APSP~\cite{Cha10}.

This new technique for shaving off logarithmic factors
can be applied to other problems, such as (\(\text{median}, +\))-convolution,
(\(\text{median}, +\))-matrix multiplication, and 3SUM-hard problems in
computational geometry including explicit 3POL.
