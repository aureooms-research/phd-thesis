\section{First Subquadratic Algorithms for 3POL}

The results in this section have been published in Paper B.
Our main contribution in this paper is the first subquadratic algorithm for
the 3POL problem (Problem~\ref{problem:3pol}).

This section is divided into four subsections:
%
In \S\ref{sec:algo:explicit:nonuniform},
we give a $O(n^{12/7+\varepsilon})$-depth bounded-degree
algebraic decision tree for explicit 3POL (\Cref{thm:explicit:act}), and in
\S\ref{sec:algo:explicit:uniform}, we adapt this decision tree
to run in $O(n^2 {(\log \log n)}^{3/2} / {(\log n)}^{1/2})$-time
in the real-RAM model (\Cref{thm:explicit:uniform}).
%
In \S\ref{sec:algo:implicit:nonuniform}, we generalize the decision tree from
\S\ref{sec:algo:explicit:nonuniform} to work for 3POL with the same depth, up
to constant factors (\Cref{thm:implicit:3POL}).
%
Finally, in \S\ref{sec:algo:implicit:uniform}, we give a real-RAM
implementation of this second decision tree to solve 3POL as fast as
explicit 3POL, up to constant factors (\Cref{thm:implicit:uniform}).

Additional details and applications can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:paper:3pol-algorithm}.
