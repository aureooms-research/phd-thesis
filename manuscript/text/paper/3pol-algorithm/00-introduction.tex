\section{The Case of 3SUM}

The 3SUM problem is defined as follows: given $n$ distinct real numbers, decide
whether any three of them sum to zero.
%
A popular conjecture is that no $O(n^{2-\delta})$-time algorithm for 3SUM
exists, for any $\delta > 0$. This conjecture has been used to show conditional
lower bounds for problems in P, notably in computational geometry with problems
such as
GeomBase, general position~\cite{GO95}
and
Polygonal Containment~\cite{BH01},
and more recently for string problems such as
Local Alignment~\cite{AVW14}
and
Jumbled Indexing~\cite{ACLL14},
as well as
dynamic versions of graph problems~\cite{P10,AV14},
triangle enumeration and Set Disjointness~\cite{KPP16}.
%
For this reason, 3SUM is considered one of the key subjects of an
emerging theory of complexity-within-P, along with other problems such as
all-pairs shortest paths,
orthogonal vectors,
boolean matrix multiplication,
and conjectures such as
the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis~\cite{AVY15,HKNS15,CGIMPS16}.

Because fixing two of the numbers $a$ and $b$ in a triple only allows for one
solution to the equation $a + b + x = 0$, an instance of 3SUM has at most
$n^2$ degenerate triples. An instance giving a matching lower bound is for
example the set $\{\,\frac{1-n}{2},\ldots,\frac{n-1}{2}\,\}$ (for odd $n$)
with $\frac{3}{4} n^2 + \frac 14$ degenerate triples.
%
One might be tempted to think that the number of ``solutions'' to the problem
would lower bound the complexity of algorithms for the decision version of the
problem, as it is the case for this problem, and other problems, in restricted
models of computation~\cite{Er96,Er99}.
%
%This is a common misconception.
This intuition is incorrect.
%
Indeed, Gr\o nlund and Pettie~\cite{GP18} proved that there exist
$\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$-depth linear decision trees and $o(n^2)$-time real-RAM
algorithms for 3SUM\@.
