Better uniform algorithms for 3SUM and 3POL.

Better nonuniform lower bound for 3SUM with 4-linear queries.

Nonuniform algorithm for 3POL based on inference dimension.

GPT in subquadratic time.

There are a few interesting questions that are left unanswered:

The best algorithms for 3SUM and 3POL are only \emph{slightly} subquadratic,
shaving a polylogarithmic factor from quadratic runtime. The best lower bound
we have for those problems \(\Omega(n \log n)\). A w
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(n^{2-\Omega(1)}\)-time real-RAM algorithm for 3SUM?
\end{openquestion}

The same question can be asked about the point location problem. The best
linear decision tree for arbitrary hyperplanes has depth \(O(d^2 \log m)\) and
the lower bound is \(\Omega(d \log m)\).
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a \(O(d \log m)\)-depth LDT for point location?
\end{openquestion}

We showed how to efficiently implement Meiser's algorithm in the word-RAM model
when applied to \(k\)-SUM. However, we did not manage to get the query
complexity down to the current state of the art.
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a word-RAM algorithm for \(k\)-SUM using \(n^{3 - \Omega(1)}\)
linear queries and running in time \(n^{\frac{k}{2}+O(1)}\)?
\end{openquestion}

We also have not managed to match the running time of the best known uniform
algorithm.
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a word-RAM algorithm for \(k\)-SUM using \(n^{o(k)}\) linear queries and
running in time \( \tilde{O}(n^{\lceil \frac k2 \rceil})\)?
\end{openquestion}

Gr\o nlund and Pettie~\cite{GP18}
showed how to solve 3SUM in slightly subquadratic time in the real-RAM model.
However, so far, their technique and its subsequent
improvements~\cite{Fr15,GS15,Ch18}, have failed to generalize to uniform algorithms
for \(k\)-SUM.
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(o(n^{\lceil \frac k2 \rceil})\)-time real-RAM algorithm for
	\(k\)-SUM with \(k \geq 4\)?
\end{openquestion}
