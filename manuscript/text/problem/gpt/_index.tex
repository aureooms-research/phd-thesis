\chapter{GPT}

\todo{Give at least one paragraph per citation on GPT.}

The General Position Testing problem (GPT) asks whether, given \(n\) points in
the plane, three of them are collinear. Because of some elementary algebra, the
following form is equivalent:

\input{text/definition/gpt-2}

Generalization of GPT to any dimension:

\input{text/definition/gpt-d}

Link to sorting when \(d=2\) and Vandermonde determinant.
