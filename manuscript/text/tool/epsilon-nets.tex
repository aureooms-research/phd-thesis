We use standard results on \enets{}. By combining a theorem due to Blumer et
al.~\cite{BEHW89} with the results of Meiser~\cite{M93}\footnote{Note that
Meiser used an older result due to Haussler and Welzl~\cite{H87} and got an
extra $\log n$ factor in the size of the $\varepsilon$-net. We thank Herv√©
Fournier for pointing this out.}, it is possible to
construct an \enet{} \(\NH\) for the range space
defined by hyperplanes and simplices using a random uniform sampling on \(\Hy\).

\input{text/theorem/epsilon-net-simplex}

The contrapositive states that if no hyperplane in \(\net\) intersects
a given simplex, then with high probability the number of hyperplanes of
\(\Hy\) intersecting the simplex is at most \(\varepsilon \card{\Hy}\).
