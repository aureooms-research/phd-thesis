\chapter{Mise-en-bouche}

\todo{Avoid definitions at all cost.}

\todo{Roadmap link to later chapters.}

This thesis is a compilation of the contributions from four papers:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[A] ``\emph{Solving \(k\)-SUM Using Few Linear Queries}''~\cite{CIO16}
	\item[B] ``\emph{Subquadratic Algorithms for Algebraic 3SUM}''~\cite{BCILOS19}
	\item[C] ``\emph{Subquadratic Encodings for Point Configurations}''~\cite{CCILO19}
	\item[D] ``\emph{Encoding 3SUM}''~\cite{CCILMO19}
\end{enumerate}
%
Paper A was presented at CG:YRF 16 and ESA 16.
%
Paper B was presented at EuroCG 17 and SoCG 17. It is published in DCG.
%
Paper C was presented at FWCG 17, EuroCG 18, and SoCG 18. It will appear in JoCG.
%
Paper D was presented at EuroCG 19.

We begin this thesis with an overview of the studied topic.
%
We explain the context in which those papers were written and expose
the contributions contained in each of them.

%\section*{SUBSET-SUM}
%Note that the unparameterized version of \(k\)-SUM is the SUBSET-SUM problem,
%which is NP-complete... Discuss nonuniform polytime algo.

%Because of that, we put Sorting and Element Uniqueness as problems at the
%origin of a zoo of problems.

\todo{Mention Moshe and Chan's paper at some point and show how it applies to
other fields (string indexing).}
