\chapter{Geometry}

We mainly consider the Euclidean plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and its
\(d\)-dimensional analog \(\mathbb{R}^d\).

\section{Arrangements of Hyperplanes}

An \emph{hyperplane} in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is the set of points \(q \in \mathbb{R}^d\)
satisfying some linear equation of the form \(\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i q_i = 0\) for
some tuple of coefficients \(p \in \mathbb{R}^d\). An \emph{affine} hyperplane has an
additional independent term \(p_0\) to get the equation \(\sum_{i=1}^{d}
p_i q_i = p_0\). In general we will drop the adjective ``affine'' and talk about
hyperplanes without specifying whether \(p_0 = 0\).

In the the plane an hyperplane is a line. In \(\mathbb{R}^3\), an hyperplane is
a plane. On the real line, an hyperplane is a point.

An hyperplane \(H\) partitions the space \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into two halfspaces,
often denoted by \(H^-\) and \(H^+\).
Naturally, \(H^-\) is defined to be the set of points such that
\(\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i q_i \leq p_0 \) and \(H^+\) is defined to be the set of
points such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i q_i \geq p_0 \). When we want to be more
precise as to whether the inequality is strict we can write \(H^{<0}\),
\(H^{\leq 0}\), \(H^{>0}\), or \(H^{\geq 0}\).
We also define \(H^0\) and \(H^{=0}\) as synonyms of \(H\).

A set of hyperplanes \(\mathcal{H} = \{\, H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_m\,\}\)
partitions \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into cells.
%
This partition is denoted by \(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{H})\) and is called the
\emph{arrangement} of \(\mathcal{H}\).
%
Each sign vector \(\sigma \in \{\,
-,0,+\,\}\) corresponds to a (potentially empty) cell of this arrangement
defined as the set of points \(q\) such that \(q \in H_i^{\sigma_i}\) for all
\(H_i \in \mathcal{H}\).

\subsection{Counting Cells}
It is interesting to understand the behavior of such arrangement.
We want to bound the number of nonempty cells an arrangement can have.

\subsection{Pseudolines}
\dots

Pseudolines are generalized into pseudohyperplanes. We do not discuss this
generalization in this thesis.

\section{A Geometric View of Algebraic Decision Problems}

Explain how any decision about polynomial predicates applied to tuples of input
real numbers is a geometry problem. Define point location.

Point location: finding the prism of the VD that contains the input point is
sufficient to answer all queries. Such a prism is defined by a linear number of
supporting queries.
