\begin{theorem}\label{thm:enet}
	For all real numbers $\varepsilon > 0, c \ge 1$,
	if we choose at least \(c n^2 \log n \varepsilon^{-1} \log
	\varepsilon^{-1} \) hyperplanes of \(\Hy\) uniformly at
random and denote this selection \(\net\) then for
any simplex intersected by more than \(\varepsilon \card{\Hy}\) hyperplanes of
\(\Hy\), with probability $1 - 2^{-\Omega(c)}$, at least one of the intersecting hyperplanes
is contained in \(\net\).
\end{theorem}
