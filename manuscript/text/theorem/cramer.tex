\begin{theorem}[Cramer's rule]\label{thm:cramer}
	If a system of $n$ linear equations for $n$ unknowns, represented in matrix
	multiplication form $Ax=b$,
	has a unique solution $x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)^T$ then, for all $i \in [n]$,
	$$
		x_i = \frac{\det(A_i)}{\det(A)}
	$$
	where $A_i$ is $A$ with the $i$th column replaced by the column vector $b$.
\end{theorem}
