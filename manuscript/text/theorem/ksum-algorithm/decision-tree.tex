\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:cube}
There exist linear decision trees of depth at most \(O(n^3\log^2 n)\) solving
the \(k\)-SUM and the \(k\)-LDT problems. Furthermore, for the two problems there
exists an $\tilde{O}(n^{\ceil{\frac{k}{2}}+8})$ Las Vegas algorithm in
the RAM model expected to perform $O(n^3\log^2 n)$ linear queries on the input.
\end{theorem}
