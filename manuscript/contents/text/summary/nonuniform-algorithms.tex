Another model of computation in which no \(o(n^d)\)-time algorithm for GPT
is known is the algebraic computation tree model.
%
In this model, an algorithm is a rooted tree whose internal nodes are either
arithmetic operations or sign tests on real variables, and whose leaves are the
result of the computation.
%
An execution of such an algorithm is a root-to-leaf path in the corresponding
tree.
%
The time complexity of this execution is the length of the path.

This model is
more generous than the real-RAM model in the sense that all computations that
can be carried out by only knowing the input size incur no cost.
%
Because a computation tree has a fixed size, we need a different tree for each
input size.
%
Therefore,
we say that this model is \emph{nonuniform} since it allows to have a
distinct algorithm for each input size.

This thesis considers both uniform algorithms in
the real-RAM~\cite[Section~2.3]{Sha78}
and
word-RAM~\cite{FW90}
models of computation and nonuniform algorithms
in the algebraic computation tree~\cite[Section~2]{Be83},
bounded-degree algebraic decision tree~\cite[Section~2]{SY82},
and linear decision tree~\cite[Section~2]{DL78} models of computation.
%
For a given task, the complexity of the nonuniform algorithm is less than
the complexity of the uniform algorithm.
%
While a nonuniform algorithm is rarely practical, designing those at least
means making progress on the question of whether a sensible computation tree
lower bound can be derived.
