\chapter{\done Divide and Conquer}

A general divide-and-conquer paradigm in algorithms is, given an instance of
size \(n\), to divide it into at most
\(a\) smaller instances of size at most \(\frac{n}{b}\) solved recursively
with an additive preprocessing and postprocessing cost of \(f(n)\), solving
constant size instances by brute force.
%
The time complexity \(T(n)\) of such an algorithm can then be expressed as the
reccurence
\begin{displaymath}
	T(n) = a \cdot T\left(\frac nb\right) + f(n).
\end{displaymath}
%
The asymptotic behavior of such a recurrence can then be derived from the
Master Theorem~\cite{BHS80,CLRS09}.

In this chapter we expose standard divide-an-conquer techniques in
Computational Geometry that allow the implementation of this paradigm (or
variants of it).
%
Papers~\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm},~\ref{paper:3pol-algorithm},
and~\ref{paper:order-type-encoding} explicitly rely on those techniques.
%
The construction in
Paper~\ref{paper:3sum-encoding} can also be interpreted as an ad-hoc
implementation of those concepts.
