An \emph{hyperplane} in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is the set of points \(q \in \mathbb{R}^d\)
satisfying a linear equation of the form \(\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i q_i = 0\) for
some tuple of coefficients \(p \in \mathbb{R}^d\). An \emph{affine} hyperplane has an
additional independent term \(p_0\) to get the equation \(\sum_{i=1}^{d}
p_i q_i = p_0\). In general we will drop the adjective ``affine'' and talk about
hyperplanes without specifying whether \(p_0 = 0\).
%
In the plane an hyperplane is a line. In \(\mathbb{R}^3\) an hyperplane is
a plane. On the real line an hyperplane is a point.

An hyperplane \(H\) partitions the space \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into two halfspaces,
often denoted by \(H^-\) and \(H^+\).
Naturally, \(H^-\) is defined to be the set of points such that
\(\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i q_i < p_0 \) and \(H^+\) is defined to be the set of
points such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i q_i > p_0 \). When we want to be more
precise as to whether the inequality is strict we can write \(H^{<}\),
\(H^{\leq}\), \(H^{>}\), or \(H^{\geq}\).
We also define \(H^0\) and \(H^{=}\) as synonyms of \(H\).

A set of hyperplanes \(\mathcal{H} = \{\, H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_m\,\}\)
partitions \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into convex regions called \emph{cells}.
%
This partition is denoted by \(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{H})\) and is called the
\emph{arrangement} of \(\mathcal{H}\).
%
Each sign vector \(\sigma \in {\{\,-,0,+\,\}}^{m}\) corresponds to a
(potentially empty) cell of this arrangement defined as the set of points \(q\)
such that \(q \in H_i^{\sigma_i}\) for all \(H_i \in \mathcal{H}\).
