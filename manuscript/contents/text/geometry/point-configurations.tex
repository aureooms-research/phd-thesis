\label{chapter:chirotopes}

Chirotopes are the generalization of order types introduced in
\S\ref{sec:problem:pol:lb}.
%
We generalize Definitions~\ref{def:order-type}
and~\ref{def:realizable-order-type} to point sets in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).

In this chapter,
we give details on two essential ingredients of our data structures in
Paper~\ref{paper:order-type-encoding}:
the classic point-hyperplane duality
and
the canonical labeling of order types and chirotopes.
%
The first one is necessary to be able to apply the encodings we obtain
for line arrangements
and hyperplane arrangements to point configurations.
%
The second is used to get the preprocessing time of those encodings down to
\(O(n^d)\).
