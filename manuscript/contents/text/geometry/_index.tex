We mainly consider the Euclidean plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and its
\(d\)-dimensional analog \(\mathbb{R}^d\).

%\chapter{Geometric View}

%Explain how any decision about polynomial predicates applied to tuples of input
%real numbers is a geometry problem. Define point location.

%Point location: finding the prism of the VD that contains the input point is
%sufficient to answer all queries. Such a prism is defined by a linear number of
%supporting queries.
