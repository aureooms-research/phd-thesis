\subsection{Points spanning unit triangles}%
\label{sec:paper:3pol-algorithm:application:triangles}

A similar problem, namely counting the number of input point triples spanning
an area $S$ triangle (provided they lie on a few curves), can also easily be
reduced to 3POL\@.
%
The polynomial to look at in this case is
\begin{displaymath}
	F(x,y,z) = X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 - 2XY - 2XZ - 2YZ + 16 S^2.
\end{displaymath}

Note that when the input points lie in the plane, the number of solutions is
more than quadratic~\cite{RS15,RSS15b}.
