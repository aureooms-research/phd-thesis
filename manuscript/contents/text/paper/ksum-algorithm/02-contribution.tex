\section{Meiser Solves \texorpdfstring{$k$-SUM}{k-SUM}}%
\label{paper:ksum-algorithm:proofs}

Our main contribution is an efficient implementation of an
existing algorithm by Meiser~\cite{M93} when applied to the \(k\)-SUM problem.

This section is divided into three subsections:
\S\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm:contrib:query-complexity} gives the outline of the
algorithm and analyses its complexity in the linear decision tree model.
\S\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm:contrib:time-complexity} gives a second
slightly more complex implementation and analysis of this algorithm in the word-RAM
model. \S\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm:contrib:query-size} gives a simple
tweak that can be applied to those algorithms in order to reduce the complexity
of the queries involved.

Missing details and the analysis of the algorithm in the algebraic computation
tree model are found in \S\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm:details}.

\section{Missing Details}\label{paper:ksum-algorithm:details}

This section regroups the missing details of the algorithms described in the
previous one (\S\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm:proofs}).

In \S\ref{app:keeplinear} we show how to keep the queries linear even though it
is not evident at first sight that they are because of all the algebra
generated by the recursive steps of the simplex construction.
%
In \S\ref{app:act} we show that our linear decision tree can be implemented in
the same time on the algebraic computation tree model, even though some linear
queries may involve all members of the input, and hence have superconstant
cost.
%
In \S\ref{app:sampling} we explain how to efficiently implement uniform random sampling
for the construction of large \(\varepsilon\)-nets.
%
In \S\ref{app:bound} we bound the size of the numbers manipulated by the
word-RAM implementation of our \(k\)-SUM algorithm.
