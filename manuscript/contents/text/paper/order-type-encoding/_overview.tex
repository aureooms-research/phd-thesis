\paragraph{Contribution}

In this contribution, we are interested in \emph{compact} encodings for
order types: we wish to design data structures using as few bits as possible
that can be used to quickly answer orientation queries of a given abstract or
realizable order type.

	In Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries} we give the tools necessary to
	attain our main result. This section can be skipped entirely if deemed
	unnecessary.

We \else%
In Section~\ref{sec:lines-and-pseudolines}, we \fi%
give the first optimal encoding for abstract
order types that allows efficient query of the orientation of any triple: the
encoding is a data structure that uses \( O(n^2) \) bits of space with queries
taking \(O(\log n)\) time in the word-RAM model with word size \(w \geq \log
n\).

Our encoding is far from being space-optimal for realizable order types.
We show that its construction can be easily tuned to only require \(O(n^2
{(\log{\log{n}})}^2 / \log{n})\) bits in this case.

In Section~\ref{sec:query-time}, we \fi%
further refine our encoding to
reduce the query time to \(O(\log{n}/\log{\log{n}})\).

In the realizable case, we give quadratic upper bounds on the
preprocessing time required to compute an encoding in the real-RAM model.
