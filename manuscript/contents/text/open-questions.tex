\chapter{Open Questions}

These are a few interesting questions that are left unanswered.

\section{About Algorithms}

The best known linear decision tree for \(k\)-SUM has depth \(O_k(n \log^2 n)\) while
the lower bound is \(\Omega_k(n \log n)\)~\cite{KLM18}
(see \S\ref{sec:developments:ksum-algorithm:KLM18}).
Can we match the information theoretic lower bound for \(k\)-SUM with linear
decision trees?
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a \(O_k(n \log n)\)-depth LDT for \(k\)-SUM?
\end{openquestion}

The same question can be asked about the point location problem. The best
linear decision tree for arbitrary hyperplanes has depth \(O(d^2 \log m)\)
and the lower bound is \(\Omega(d \log m)\)~\cite{ES17}
(see \S\ref{sec:developments:ksum-algorithm:ES17}).
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a \(O(d \log m)\)-depth LDT for point location?
\end{openquestion}

In Paper~\ref{paper:ksum-algorithm}
we show how to efficiently implement Meiser's algorithm in the word-RAM model
when applied to \(k\)-SUM. Can the same be done for the algorithms of Ezra and
Sharir~\cite{ES17} and Kane, Lovett, and Moran~\cite{KLM18}?
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a word-RAM algorithm for \(k\)-SUM using \(n^{3 - \Omega(1)}\)
linear queries and running in time \(n^{\frac{k}{2}+O(1)}\)?
\end{openquestion}

We also have not managed to match the running time of the best known uniform
algorithm (see \S\ref{sec:problem:sum:uniform-algorithms}).
\begin{openquestion}
Is there a word-RAM algorithm for \(k\)-SUM using \(n^{o(k)}\) linear queries and
running in time \( \tilde{O}(n^{\lceil \frac k2 \rceil})\)?
\end{openquestion}

Gr\o nlund and Pettie~\cite{GP18}
showed how to solve 3SUM in subquadratic time in the real-RAM model.
However, so far, their technique and its subsequent
improvements~\cite{Fr15,GS15,Ch18}, have failed to generalize to uniform algorithms
for \(k\)-SUM.
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(o(n^{\lceil \frac k2 \rceil})\)-time real-RAM algorithm for
	\(k\)-SUM with \(k \geq 4\)?
\end{openquestion}

The best known algorithms for 3SUM are only \emph{slightly} subquadratic,
shaving a polylogarithmic factor from quadratic runtime.
In Paper~\ref{paper:3pol-algorithm}, we show how to adapt one of those
algorithms to solve the 3POL problem within the same time bound.
%
The best lower bound we have for those problems is \(\Omega(n \log n)\). The
current conjecture is that no significant improvement can be made with respect
to known algorithms (see
\S\ref{sec:problem:sum}).
%
We have to ask if this is indeed true.
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(n^{2-\Omega(1)}\)-time real-RAM algorithm for 3SUM?
\end{openquestion}

The question can also be asked more generally for 3POL.
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(n^{2-\Omega(1)}\)-time real-RAM algorithm for 3POL?
\end{openquestion}

The best known nonuniform algorithm for 3SUM is a \(6\)-linear decision tree of
depth \(O(n \log^2 n)\) (see \S\ref{sec:developments:ksum-algorithm:KLM18}),
the nonuniform algorithms in~\cite{GP18,Fr15,GS15} are
\(4\)-linear decision trees of depth \( \tilde{O}(n^{3/2}) \), and we know that
there is no \(3\)-linear decision tree of depth \(o(n^2)\) for
3SUM~\cite{Er99a} (see \S\ref{sec:problem:sum}).
We want to know whether better \(4\)-linear decision trees exists for 3SUM.
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(o(n^{3/2})\)-depth \(4\)-linear decision tree for 3SUM?
\end{openquestion}

If this is the case, then we would also like to know if this model of
computation suffers from more severe limitations than the \(6\)-linear decision tree
model.
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(n \log^{O(1)} n\)-depth \(4\)-linear decision tree for 3SUM?
\end{openquestion}

The inference dimension method introduced in~\cite{KLM18} is essentially a
pigeon hole argument applied to linear combinations of linear equations with small coefficients.
At first sight, this kind of argument does not seem to apply to polynomial
equations, even when the polynomials are of degree two. One can of course apply
a Veronese embedding~\cite{Har77,Har13} to linearize the equations but this has
the effect of blowing up the dimension which directly impacts the efficiency of
the method. Could some generalization of inference dimension, or any other
method,
improve on the \(O(n^{12/7 + \varepsilon})\) nonuniform time bound we obtain in
Paper~\ref{paper:3pol-algorithm}?
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(o(n^{12/7})\)-depth bounded-degree algebraic decision tree or
	algebraic computation tree for 3POL?
\end{openquestion}

In \S\ref{sec:paper:3pol-algorithm:application:gpt} we show how 3POL algorithms
can be used to solve particular instances of GPT in subquadratic time.
Despite all our efforts, we still lack a subquadratic algorithm for GPT in the
general case, even a
nonuniform one. Like 3SUM and 3POL, the best known lower bound is \(\Omega(n
\log n)\) (see \S\ref{sec:problem:pol:lb}).
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(o(n^2)\)-depth bounded-degree algebraic decision tree or
	algebraic computation tree for GPT?
\end{openquestion}


\section{About Encodings}

In Paper~\ref{paper:order-type-encoding}
we show how to get compact encodings for abstract order types with slightly
sublogarithmic query time. Is it possible to bring this query time down to
constant, or event just strongly sublogarithmic?
%
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(O(n^2)\)-bits \(O(\log^{1-\epsilon} n )\)-querytime encoding for
	abstract order types?
\end{openquestion}

In the same paper,
we manage to get slightly subquadratic space encodings for realizable order
types. Is it possible to get this down to strongly subquadratic while keeping
the query time reasonable, say polynomial?
%
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(n^{2-\Omega(1)}\)-bits \(n^{O(1)}\)-querytime encoding for
	realizable order types?
\end{openquestion}

In Paper~\ref{paper:3sum-encoding}
we modify Gr\o nlund and Pettie's nonunifom algorithm to obtain a 3SUM type
encoding with a strongly subquadratic space requirement and efficient queries.
Is there any way to exploit the nearlinear decision tree in~\cite{KLM18} to
obtain a better space bound while keeping query time efficient?
\begin{openquestion}
	Is there a \(o(n^{3/2})\)-bits \(\log^{O(1)} n\)-querytime encoding for
	3SUM types?
\end{openquestion}
