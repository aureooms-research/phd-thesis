\chapter{Models of Computation}%
\label{chapter:models-of-computation}

In Theoretical Computer Science, we simplify reality in order to make our job
easier: we create models of what we think computers are and use mathematics to
reason about them.
%
This allows us, not only to show, but to \emph{prove} that our algorithms are
correct and efficient, according to those models.
%
Hopefully we manage to capture the essence of what practical computation is
about, making our lemmas and theorems relevant in practice.

We have to start this thesis somewhere, and,
for our results to make sense,
it is only natural that we begin by defining the models we
use.
