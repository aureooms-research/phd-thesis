\section{GPT \& 3POL}\label{sec:problem:pol}

In the plane, the General Position Testing problem (GPT) asks whether, given
\(n\) points, three of them are collinear. Because of some
elementary algebra, the following form is equivalent:
%
\input{text/definition/gpt-2}

Note that this determinant is a degree-two polynomial in six variables
\begin{displaymath}
	x_i y_j - y_i x_j - x_i y_k + y_i x_k + x_j y_k - y_j x_k.
\end{displaymath}

In Computational Geometry it is better know as the clockwise/counterclockwise predicate
and is more commonly written
\begin{displaymath}
	(x_j - x_i)(y_k - y_i) - (y_j - y_i)(x_k - x_i),
\end{displaymath}
with only five subtractions and two multiplications.

The problem generalizes to higher dimension: given \(n\) points in
\(\mathbb{R}^d\), decide whether any \(d+1\) of them lie on a common
hyperplane. Again, using algebra:
%
\input{text/definition/gpt-d}

Again, this determinant is a degree \(d\) polynomial in
\(d^2 + d\) variables.

Later in this document we mention GPT without specifying the dimension.
The problem is then assumed to be in the plane.
When we consider a different parameterization we explicitly mention it.

When \(d=1\), GPT is exactly the element uniqueness problem.
%
\input{text/definition/gpt-1}

A seemingly stupid way to solve this problem is to
consider the Vandermonde matrix
%
\begin{displaymath}
V(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
    1       & x_1     & x_1^2     & \dots  & x_1^{n-1}     \\
    1       & x_2     & x_2^2     & \dots  & x_2^{n-1}     \\
    \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots    & \ddots & \vdots        \\
    1       & x_n & x_n^2 & \dots  & x_n^{n-1}
\end{pmatrix},
\end{displaymath}
%
and to compute its determinant
%
\begin{displaymath}
\det(V(q)) = \begin{vmatrix}
    1       & q_1     & q_1^2     & \dots  & q_1^{n-1}     \\
    1       & q_2     & q_2^2     & \dots  & q_2^{n-1}     \\
    \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots    & \ddots & \vdots        \\
    1       & q_n & q_n^2 & \dots  & q_n^{n-1}
\end{vmatrix}
=
\prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (q_j - q_i).
\end{displaymath}

We consider an algebraic generalization of the 3SUM problem: we replace the sum
function by a constant-degree polynomial in three variables $F \in
\mathbb{R}[x,y,z]$ and ask to determine whether there exists a
\emph{degenerate} triple $(a,b,c)$ of input numbers such that $F(a,b,c)=0$. We
call this new problem the \emph{3POL problem}.

\input{text/definition/3pol}

Some combinatorics aspects of the 3POL problem have already been studied.
%
For the particular case $F(x,y,z) = f(x,y) - z$ where $f \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$
is a constant-degree bivariate polynomial, Elekes and R贸nyai~\cite{ER00} show
that the number of degenerate triples is $o(n^2)$ unless $f$ is
\emph{special}. Special for $f$ means that $f$ has one of the two special forms
\begin{displaymath}
f(u,v)=h(\varphi(u)+\psi(v))
\qquad
\text{or}
\qquad
f(u,v)=h(\varphi(u)\cdot\psi(v)),
\end{displaymath}
where $h,\varphi,\psi$ are univariate polynomials of constant degree.
It must be noted that the 3SUM problem falls in the special category since, in
that case, \( f \) is the sum function.
%
Elekes and Szab贸~\cite{ES12} later generalized this result to a broader range
of functions $F$ using a wider definition of specialness.
%
Raz, Sharir and Solymosi~\cite{RSS14} and Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15}
improved both bounds to $O(n^{11/6})$.
%
They translated the problem into an incidence problem between points and
constant-degree algebraic curves. Then, they showed that unless $f$ (or $F$) is
special, these curves have low multiplicities. Finally, they applied a theorem
due to Pach and Sharir~\cite{PS98} bounding the number of incidences between
the points and the curves. Some of these ideas appear in our approach.


\subsection{Combinatorics Results on 3POL and GPT}
In a series of results spanning fifteen years,
Elekes and R贸nyai~\cite{ER00},
Elekes and Szab贸~\cite{ES12},
Raz, Sharir and Solymosi~\cite{RSS14}, and
Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15}
give upper bounds on the number of degenerate triples for the 3POL problem.
The last and strongest result is the following:
\begin{theorem}[Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15}]
	Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be $n$-sets of real numbers and $F \in \mathbb{R}[x,y,z]$
	be a polynomial of constant degree, then
	\begin{displaymath}
		%| \{\, (a,b,c) \in ( A \times B \times C ) \st F(a,b,c) = 0 \,\} | = O(n^{11/6}),
		| Z(F) \cap ( A \times B \times C ) | = O(n^{11/6}),
	\end{displaymath}
	unless $F$ has some group related form.\footnote{Because our results do not
	depend on the meaning of \emph{group related form}, we do not bother
	defining it here. We refer the reader to Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15}
	for the exact definition.}
\end{theorem}

Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15} also look at the number of degenerate
triples for the General Position Testing problem when the input is restricted
to points lying on a constant number of constant-degree algebraic curves.
\begin{theorem}[Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15}]\label{thm:rsz15:col}
Let $C_1, C_2, C_3$ be three (not necessarily distinct) irreducible algebraic curves
of degree at most $d$ in $\mathbb{C}^2$, and let $S_1 \subset C_1, S_2 \subset C_2, S_3
\subset C_3$ be finite subsets. Then the
number of proper collinear triples in $S_1 \times S_2 \times S_3$ is
\begin{displaymath}
	O_d( |S_1|^{1/2} |S_2|^{2/3} |S_3|^{2/3} + |S_1|^{1/2} (|S_1|^{1/2} + |S_2| +
|S_3| ) ),
\end{displaymath}
unless $C_1 \cup C_2 \cup C_3$ is a line or a cubic curve.
\end{theorem}

Nassajian Mojarrad, Pham, Valculescu and de Zeeuw~\cite{MPVd16} and
Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ16} proved bounds for versions of the
problem where $F$ is a $4$-variate polynomial.
