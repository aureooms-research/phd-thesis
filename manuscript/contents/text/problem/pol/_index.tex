\section{GPT \& 3POL}%
\label{sec:problem:pol}

In the plane, the General Position Testing problem (GPT) asks whether, given
\(n\) points, three of them are collinear~\cite{???}.
%
Because of some elementary algebra, the following form is equivalent:
%
\input{text/definition/gpt-2}

Note that this determinant is a degree-two polynomial in six variables
\begin{displaymath}
	x_i y_j - y_i x_j - x_i y_k + y_i x_k + x_j y_k - y_j x_k.
\end{displaymath}

In Computational Geometry this determinant is better known as
the (counterclockwise) orientation \(\nabla(i,j,k) \in \{\, -, 0, +\,\}\) of
the points
\(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) with coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\), \((x_j, y_j)\), and
\((x_k, y_k)\) and is defined as the sign of this determinant.
%
It is called \emph{orientation} or \emph{sidedness}
because for three given points this sign
gives the orientation of the triangle those points define.
%
It is often written as
\begin{displaymath}
    \nabla(i,j,k) = \mathrm{sign}((x_j - x_i)(y_k - y_i) - (y_j - y_i)(x_k - x_i)),
\end{displaymath}
with only five subtractions and two multiplications.

The problem generalizes to higher dimension: given \(n\) points in
\(\mathbb{R}^d\), decide whether any \(d+1\) of them lie on a common
hyperplane. Again, using algebra:
%
\input{text/definition/gpt-d}

Again, this determinant is a degree \(d\) polynomial in
\(d^2 + d\) variables.

Later in this document we mention GPT without specifying the dimension.
The problem is then assumed to be in the plane.
When we consider a different parameterization we explicitly mention it.

\subsection{Variants}%
\label{sec:problem:pol:variants}

Similarly to the 3SUM problem, we can study a
variant of GPT where the tested triples come from different sets.
%
\input{text/definition/gpt-2-variant}

This variant is useful for a particular reduction from 3SUM.
A similar variant can be defined for the \(d\)-dimensional problem.

\subsection{Reductions from \(k\)-SUM}%
\label{sec:problem:pol:reductions-from-ksum}

This section is divided into two parts.
%
The first part exposes a folk reduction from \(k\)-SUM to GPT showing
GPT in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is as hard as \((d+1\))-SUM.
%
The second part exposes other interesting connections between \(k\)-SUM and GPT
that can be drawn through Vandermonde determinants, yielding equivalent
hardness proofs for GPT~\cite{Er99b}.


\subsubsection{Folklore}

Given an instance of the three-set variant of 3SUM,
we can reduce it to an instance of GPT where the input sets are on three
horizontal lines.
%
\begin{observation}[label=obs:3sum-to-gpt]
Given three sets \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) of \(n\) real numbers, let
\begin{align*}
    A' &= \{\, a' = (a,0) \colon\, a \in A\,\},\\
    B' &= \{\, b' = (b,2) \colon\, b \in B\,\},\\
    C' &= \{\, c' = (-c/2,1) \colon\, c \in C\,\}.
\end{align*}
Then for any \(a \in A\), \(b \in B\), and \(c \in C\), we have that
\(a+b+c=0\) if and only if \(a'\), \(b'\), and \(c'\) are collinear.
\end{observation}
%
\begin{proof}
    The equation of a line defined by points \(a' \in A'\) and \(b' \in B'\)
    is
    \begin{align*}
	y &= \frac{2}{b-a} x - \frac{2}{b-a} a\\
	\iff x &= a + \frac{y (b-a)}{2},
    \end{align*}
    which simplifies to \(x = \frac{a+b}{2}\) when \(y = 1\).
\end{proof}

Therefore, solving GPT is at least as hard as solving 3SUM.

In the dual (see \S\ref{sec:point-configurations:duality}),
this reduction is even easier to apprehend and trivially
generalizes to \(d\)-dimensional GPT.
%
\begin{observation}
Given \(k\) sets \(S_i\) of \(n\) real numbers,
in \(\mathbb{R}^{k-1}\)
let
\(S_i'\), \(1 \leq i \leq k-1\),
be the set of \(n\) hyperplanes \(x_i = s\) for \(s \in S_i\) and let
\(S_k'\) be the set of \(n\) hyperplanes \(\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i + s = 0\) for
\(s \in S_k\).
Then for any \(s_i \in S_i\), \(1 \leq i \leq k\),
we have that
\(\sum_{i=1}^{k} s_i = 0\)
if and only if
the corresponding hyperplanes intersect.
\end{observation}
%
\begin{proof}
    Trivially.
\end{proof}
%
This proves that GPT in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is as hard as (\(d+1\))-SUM.

\subsubsection{Points on the Weird Moment Curve}

When \(d=1\), GPT is exactly the element uniqueness problem.
%
\input{text/definition/gpt-1}

One seemingly stupid way to solve this problem is to
consider the Vandermonde matrix
%
\begin{displaymath}
V(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
    1       & x_1     & x_1^2     & \dots  & x_1^{n-1}     \\
    1       & x_2     & x_2^2     & \dots  & x_2^{n-1}     \\
    \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots    & \ddots & \vdots        \\
    1       & x_n & x_n^2 & \dots  & x_n^{n-1}
\end{pmatrix},
\end{displaymath}
%
and to compute its determinant
%
\begin{displaymath}
|V(q)| = \det\begin{pmatrix}
    1       & q_1     & q_1^2     & \dots  & q_1^{n-1}     \\
    1       & q_2     & q_2^2     & \dots  & q_2^{n-1}     \\
    \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots    & \ddots & \vdots        \\
    1       & q_n & q_n^2 & \dots  & q_n^{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (q_j - q_i).
\end{displaymath}

This can be done in \(O(n \log n)\) ring multiplications
by defining
%
\(p(x) = \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (x-q_i)\)
%
and computing
%
\begin{align*}
{\det(V(q))}^2 &= \mathrm{disc}_x(p(x)) \\
&= {(-1)}^{\binom{n}{2}} \mathrm{res}_x(p(x), \mathrm{diff}_x(p(x))) \\
&= {(-1)}^{\binom{n}{2}} \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \mathrm{diff}_x(p(x))(q_i),
\end{align*}
%
using fast polynomial interpolation to first find the coefficients of
\(p(x)\) and then using fast polynomial evaluation to evaluate
\(\mathrm{diff}_x(p(x))\) at all \(q_i\)~\cite{St73,Ku73a,Ku73b,ASU75}.

Consider points on the moment curve $m_d(t) = (t, t^2, \ldots, t^d)$. Given a
GPT instance consisting of points $m_d(q_i)$ on this curve the determinant
in Problem~\ref{problem:gpt-d} becomes
%
\begin{displaymath}
\det\begin{pmatrix}
1      & q_1^1 & q_1^2 & \cdots & q_1^d \\
1      & q_2^1 & q_2^2 & \cdots & q_2^d \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
1      & q_{d+1}^1 & q_{d+1}^2 & \cdots & q_{d+1}^d
\end{pmatrix}
=
|V(q)|,
\end{displaymath}
and solving the problem amounts to deciding Element Uniqueness.

Consider points on the \emph{weird} moment curve $\omega_d(t) = (t, t^2, \ldots,
t^{d-1}, t^{d+1})$~\cite{Er99b}.
If our input only consists of points $\omega_d(q_i)$ on this curve then the
determinant becomes
%
\begin{displaymath}
\det\begin{pmatrix}
1      & q_0^1 & q_0^2 & \cdots & q_0^{d-1} & q_0^{d+1} \\
1      & q_1^1 & q_1^2 & \cdots & q_1^{d-1} & q_1^{d+1} \\
\vdots & \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots  \\
1      & q_d^1 & q_d^2 & \cdots & q_d^{d-1} & q_d^{d+1}
\end{pmatrix} = |V(q)| \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{d+1} q_i,
\end{displaymath}
%
which is the predicate we want to test for $(d+1)$-SUM (modulo the $|V(q)|$
factor which is nonzero for distinct input numbers).

In the plane, this reduction from instances of 3SUM to points on
the cubic curve \(\omega_2(t) = (t, t^3)\) is also part of folklore.
%Note that the weird moment curve in two dimensions is precisely the cubic curve
%from the reduction from 3SUM to GPT.

\subsection{Lower Bounds and Order Types}%
\label{sec:problem:pol:lb}

Even though 3SUM and \(k\)-SUM reduce to GPT, it does not necessarily mean that
the lower bounds for those problems carry over.
%
The lower bounds in
\S\ref{sec:problem:sum:itlb} are in the linear decision tree model and we
cannot hope to solve GPT in those models because they do not allow us to answer
quadratic polynomial queries on the input.
%
That being said, solving an instance of GPT as in \Cref{obs:3sum-to-gpt} with
orientation predicates is the same as trying to solve the original 3SUM
instance with \(3\)-linear queries. Hence, the quadratic lower bound of
Erickson~\cite{Er99a} carries over and GPT requires \(\Omega(n^2)\) time in a
model where one is only allowed orientation queries. More generally, GPT in
\(\mathbb{R}^d\) requires \(\Omega(n^{\lceil \frac{d+1}{2} \rceil})\) time in a
model where one is only allowed to query the orientation of \(d\)-simplexes of
the input points.

However, neither those lower bounds, nor the weaker ones in the \(n\)-linear
decision tree model, carry over in the more generous algebraic decision
tree model and algebraic computation tree model.
%
To get a superlinear lower bound for GPT in those models we need work a little
bit harder.

Given an instance of GPT, its \emph{order type} is defined to be the map that
sends each triple of input points to its orientation.
%
\input{text/definition/order-type}
%
If we consider the problem of identifying the order type of a set of points, we
can achieve a lower bound that holds in any arbitrary decision tree model. It
suffices for that to bound the number of possible order types.
%
\input{text/theorem/GP86}
%
With the following corollary
\begin{corollary}
    A decision tree identifying the order type of a point sets has depth
    \(\Omega(n \log n)\).
\end{corollary}

The question now is whether we can do the same as in the Element Uniqueness vs
Sorting case: show that the decision problem is as hard as the identification
problem. Ben-Or shows exactly that
%
\begin{theorem}[name=Ben-Or~\cite{Be83},label=thm:Be83]
    Given any set \(W \subset \mathbb{R}^d\),
    let \(N = \max \{\, \# W , \#(\mathbb{R}^d - W)\,\}\),
    where \(\#(\cdot)\) denotes the number of connected components of a set.
    The depth of any algebraic
    computation tree or bounded-degree algebraic decision tree
    deciding whether an input point \(q \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is in \(W\)
    is \(\Omega(\log N - d)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    Any algebraic computation tree or bounded-degree algebraic decision tree
    that solves GPT has depth \(\Omega(n \log n)\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(W \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}\) be the set defined by the union of the
    \(n \choose 3\) algebraic varieties of equation
    \begin{displaymath}
	(x_j - x_i)(y_k - y_i) - (y_j - y_i)(x_k - x_i) = 0.
    \end{displaymath}
    %
    Solving GPT on input \(q \in \mathbb{R}^{2n}\)
    amounts to deciding whether \(q \in W\).
    %
    The set \(\mathbb{R}^{2n} - W\) has \(2^{\Omega(n \log n)}\) connected
    components by
    \Cref{thm:GP86}.
\end{proof}

Note that both
\Cref{thm:GP86}
and
\Cref{thm:Be83} rely on
the
Petrovski\u{\i}-Ole\u{\i}nik-Thom-Milnor (POTM) Theorem that
bounds the number of connected components of
algebraic varieties~\cite{Mi64,Th65,BPR06}.

%Complexity of an arrangement of surfaces~\cite[24.1.4]{Hal04}.

\subsection{Algorithms}%
\label{sec:problem:pol:algorithms}

By brute-force, GPT can be solved in \(O(n^3)\) time.
%
Quadratic time can be achieved by constructing the dual
arrangement~\cite[Theorem 24.4.1]{Hal04}.
%
No subquadratic algorithm known, uniform or nonuniform.
%
Essentially, nothing known.


\subsection{More on Order Types}%
\label{sec:problem:pol:order-types}

A great deal of the literature in computational geometry deals with the notion
of order type~\cite{%
AAK02a,
AAK02b,
ACKLV16,
AKPV14,
AK01,
AK05,
AKMPW15,
AMP13,
Al86,
AILOW14,
BLSWZ93,
BMS01,
BRS92,
Epp18,
EHN99,
Fe96,
FV11,
FL78,
Go80,
GP83,
GP84,
GP86,
GP91,
GP93,
GPS89,
HM94,
HMMS11,
Knu92,
Le26,
MMIB12,
NV98,
Ri89,
RZ04,
Ri56,
St97%
}.
The order type of a point set has been further abstracted into combinatorial
objects known as (rank-three) \emph{oriented matroids}~\cite{FL78}. The
\emph{chirotope axioms} define consistent systems of signs of
triples~\cite{BLSWZ93}.
%
From the topological representation theorem~\cite{BMS01}, all such
\emph{abstract} order types correspond to pseudoline arrangements, while, from
the standard projective duality, order types of point sets correspond to
straight line arrangements. See Chapter 6 of The Handbook for more
details~\cite{RZ04}.

When the order type of a pseudoline arrangement can be realized by an
arrangement of straight lines, we call the pseudoline arrangement
\emph{stretchable}.
%
As an example of a nonstretchable arrangement, Levi gives Pappus's
configuration where eight triples of concurrent straight lines force a ninth,
whereas the ninth triple cannot be enforced by pseudolines~\cite{Le26} (see
Figure~\ref{fig:pappus}).
%
Ringel shows how to convert the so-called ``non-Pappus'' arrangement of
Figure~\ref{fig:pappus}~(b) to a simple arrangement while preserving
nonstretchability~\cite{Ri56}.
%
All arrangements of eight or fewer pseudolines are stretchable~\cite{GP80}, and
the only nonstretchable simple arrangement of nine pseudolines is the one given
by Ringel~\cite{Ri89}.
%
More information on pseudoline arrangements is available in Chapter 5 of The
Handbook~\cite{Goo04}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering{}
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
		\centering{}
		\includegraphics[scale=.7]{figures/pappus-realizable}
		\caption{Realizable order type.}
    \end{subfigure}%
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
		\centering{}
		\includegraphics[scale=.7]{figures/pappus-abstract}
		\caption{Abstract order type which is not realizable.}
    \end{subfigure}
	\caption{Pappus's configuration.}\label{fig:pappus}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:pappus} shows that not all pseudoline arrangements are
stretchable. Indeed, most are not: there are \(2^{\Theta(n^2)}\)
abstract order types~\cite{Fe96} and only \(2^{\Theta(n \log n)}\) realizable
order types (\Cref{thm:GP86}).
%
\input{text/theorem/Fe96}
%
This discrepancy stems from the algebraic nature of realizable order types, as
illustrated by the main tool used in the upper bound proofs (the
POTM Theorem~\cite{Mi64,Th65,BPR06}).

\subsection{Encodings}%
\label{sec:problem:pol:encodings}

At SoCG'86, Bernard Chazelle asked~\cite{GP93}:
\begin{quotation}
``How many bits does it take to know an order type?''
\end{quotation}

This question is of importance in Computational Geometry for the following two
reasons:
%
First, in many algorithms dealing with sets of points in the plane,
the only relevant information carried by the input is the combinatorial
configuration of the points given by the orientation of each triple of points in the
set (clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear)~\cite{Knu92,Ed12,Epp18}.
%
Second, computers as we know them can only handle numbers with
finite description and we cannot assume that they can handle arbitrary
real numbers without some sort of encoding. The study of \emph{robust}
algorithms is focused on ensuring the correct solution of problems on finite
precision machines. Chapter 41 of The Handbook of Discrete and Computational
Geometry is dedicated to this issue~\cite{Ya04}.


Regarding encoding the function \(\chi\) of \Cref{def:order-type}
(as in \Cref{def:encoding}),
\Cref{thm:Fe96} together with information theory
imply that \(\Theta(n^2)\) bits are necessary
and sufficient for abstract order types whereas \(\Theta(n \log n)\) bits are
necessary and sufficient for realizable order types.
Optimal encodings matching those bounds can be produced
by a simple enumeration algorithm.
%
However, it is unclear how the original information can be
efficiently reconstructed from those encodings.
%
On the other hand, storing all \( \binom{n}{3} \) orientations in a lookup
table to render this information accessible seems wasteful.

Another obvious idea for encoding the order type of a point set is to store
the coordinates of the points, and answer orientation queries
by computing the corresponding determinant. While this should work in many practical
settings, it cannot work for all point sets. Perles's configuration shows that
some configuration of points, containing collinear triples, forces at least one
coordinate to be irrational~\cite{Gr05} (see Figure~\ref{fig:perles}).
%
It is easy to see that
order types of points in general position can always be represented by rational
(or integer) coordinates.
%
However, it is well known that some configurations require doubly
exponential coordinates, hence coordinates with exponential bitsizes if
represented in the binary numeral system~\cite{GPS89}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering{}
	\includegraphics[scale=.7]{figures/perles}
	\caption{Perles's configuration.}\label{fig:perles}
\end{figure}

Goodman and Pollack defined \(\lambda\)-matrices which can encode abstract order
types using \( O(n^2 \log{n}) \) bits~\cite{GP83} and can be constructed in
\(O(n^2)\) time~\cite{EOS86}. They asked if the space
requirements could be moved closer to the information-theoretic lower bounds.
Everett, Hurtado, and Noy complained that this encoding does not
allow a fast decoding for individual triples~\cite{EHN99}.
Knuth and Streinu independently gave new encodings of size \(O(n^2 \log n)\)
that allow orientation queries in constant time~\cite{Knu92,St97}.\footnote{%
We attract the attention of the reader on the fact that we express size in
bits.
Other authors,~\cite{EHN99} and~\cite{St97} in particular,
express size in number of words, which is off by at least a logarithmic factor.}
Felsner and Valtr showed how to encode abstract order types optimally in
\(O(n^2)\) bits via the wiring diagram of their corresponding allowable
sequence~\cite{Fe96, FV11} (as defined in~\cite{Go80}). Aloupis et al.\ gave
an encoding of size \(O(n^2)\) that can be computed in \(O(n^2)\) time and that
can be used to test for the isomorphism of two distinct point sets in the same
amount of time~\cite{AILOW14}.

\subsection{The Intermediate Problem}
\label{sec:problem:pol:3pol}

On par with GPT we consider an algebraic generalization of the 3SUM problem:
we replace the sum function by a constant-degree polynomial in three variables
$F \in \mathbb{R}[x,y,z]$ and ask to determine whether there exists a
\emph{degenerate} triple $(a,b,c)$ of input numbers such that $F(a,b,c)=0$. We
call this problem the \emph{3POL problem}.
%
\input{text/definition/3pol}

In addition to generalizing 3SUM, this problem can model particular
instances of GPT: consider points in the plane that are constrained to
lie on three parameterized polynomial curves of constant degree, then an
algorithm for 3POL can determine whether any three of those points are
collinear. Note that this generalizes the reductions from 3SUM found in
\S\ref{sec:problem:pol:reductions-from-ksum}, where the input points either lie
on three horizontal lines or on a single cubic curve.
%
In fact, this problem is not new: it has already been studied before from a
combinatorics point of view as exposed in the next section.

\subsection{Combinatorics}%
\label{sec:problem:pol:combinatorics}

In a series of results spanning fifteen years,
Elekes and Rónyai~\cite{ER00},
Elekes and Szabó~\cite{ES12},
Raz, Sharir and Solymosi~\cite{RSS14}, and
Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15}
give upper bounds on the number of degenerate triples for the 3POL problem.
%
For the particular case $F(x,y,z) = f(x,y) - z$ where $f \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$
is a constant-degree bivariate polynomial, Elekes and Rónyai~\cite{ER00} show
that the number of degenerate triples is $o(n^2)$ unless $f$ is
\emph{special}. Special for $f$ means that $f$ has one of the two special forms
\begin{displaymath}
f(u,v)=h(\varphi(u)+\psi(v))
\qquad
\text{or}
\qquad
f(u,v)=h(\varphi(u)\cdot\psi(v)),
\end{displaymath}
where $h,\varphi,\psi$ are univariate polynomials of constant degree.
It must be noted that the 3SUM problem falls in the special category since, in
that case, \( f \) is the sum function.
%
Elekes and Szabó~\cite{ES12} later generalized this result to a broader range
of functions $F$ using a wider definition of specialness.
%
Raz, Sharir and Solymosi~\cite{RSS14} and Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15}
improved both bounds to $O(n^{11/6})$.
%
They translated the problem into an incidence problem between points and
constant-degree algebraic curves. Then, they showed that unless $f$ (or $F$) is
special, these curves have low multiplicities. Finally, they applied a theorem
due to Pach and Sharir~\cite{PS98} bounding the number of incidences between
the points and the curves.
%
\input{text/theorem/RSZ15}

Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ15} also look at the number of degenerate
triples for the General Position Testing problem when the input is restricted
to points lying on a constant number of constant-degree algebraic curves.
%
\input{text/theorem/RSZ15-gpt}

Nassajian Mojarrad, Pham, Valculescu and de Zeeuw~\cite{MPVd16} and
Raz, Sharir and de Zeeuw~\cite{RSZ16} proved bounds for versions of the
problem where $F$ is a $4$-variate polynomial.
