\chapter{History}

In this chapter we define and recount the history of the different problems on
which we made progress:
%
3SUM and \(k\)-SUM (\S\ref{sec:history:sum}),
and
GPT and 3POL (\S\ref{sec:history:pol}).

Note that we only consider knowledge predating the publication of our results.
For later developments see \S\ref{chapter:developments}.
