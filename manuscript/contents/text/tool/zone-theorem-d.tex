In~\cite{EOS86} and in the first edition of~\cite{Ed12}, there were claims of
generalization of this result to arrangements of hyperplanes in higher
dimension.
%
However, the proofs turned out to be flawed~\cite{ESS93}.
%
Edelsbrunner, Sturmfels, and Sharir were the first to provide a valid proof of
the generalized result~\cite{ESS93}.

They also cite valid proofs by Houle and Matou{\v s}ek for a weaker version of the
theorem:

The Zone Theorem bounds the sum of complexities of the cells in a zone.

The full generalization of the theorem defines the complexity of each cell to
be the number of all \(0\)-faces, \(1\)-faces, \dots, and (\(d-1\))-faces
supporting the cell.

The weak generalization only counts (\(d-1\))-faces.

However, no publication of those proofs is known to the authors.
