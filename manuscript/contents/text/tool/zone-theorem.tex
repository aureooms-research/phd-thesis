The zone of a given pseudoline of an arrangement is the set of cells of the
arrangement supported by that pseudoline.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:a-zone-in-the-plane} illustrates a zone in a two-dimensional
arrangement of lines.

We define the complexity of each cell to be the number of its sides.
We define the complexity of a zone to be the sum of the complexities of its cells.
%
The Zone Theorem states that the complexity of any zone is linear.

This result is important because it allows optimal
incremental construction of arrangements of line arrangements, a frequently
used tool.
