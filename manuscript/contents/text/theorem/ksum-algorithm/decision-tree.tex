There exist linear decision trees of depth \(O(n^3\log^2 n)\) solving
the \(k\)-SUM and the \(k\)-LDT problems. Furthermore, for the \(k\)-SUM
problem there
exists an $\tilde{O}(n^{\ceil{\frac{k}{2}}+8})$ Las Vegas algorithm in
the word-RAM model expected to perform $O(n^3 \log^2 n)$ linear queries on the input.
This algorithm also solves the \(k\)-LDT problem within the same time bounds
provided the coefficients of the underlying linear equation are constant rational numbers.
