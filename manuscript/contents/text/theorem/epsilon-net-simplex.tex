\begin{lemma}\label{thm:enet}
	For all real numbers $r > 1$ and $c \ge 1$, if we choose at least \(c
	n^2 \log n r \log r \) hyperplanes of \(\Hy\)
	uniformly at random and denote this selection \(\net\) then for any simplex
	intersected by more than \(\frac{| \Hy |}{r}\) hyperplanes of \(\Hy\),
	with probability $1 - 2^{-\Omega(c)}$, at least one of the intersecting
	hyperplanes is contained in \(\net\).
\end{lemma}
