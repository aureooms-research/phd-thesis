\begin{theorem}[name={Buck~\cite{Bu43}, see also~\cite[Theorem~24.1.1 and Corollary~24.1.2]{Hal04}},label=thm:buck]
Consider the partition of space defined by an arrangement of $m$ hyperplanes in
$\R^d$.
The number of regions of dimension $k \le d$ is at most
\begin{displaymath}
	{m \choose d-k} \sum_{i=0}^{k} {m-d+k \choose i}.
\end{displaymath}
This bound is attained when the hyperplanes are in general position.
The number of regions of all dimensions is \(\Theta(m^d)\) in that case.
\end{theorem}
