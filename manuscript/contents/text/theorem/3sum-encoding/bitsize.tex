Every 3SUM instance has an equivalent integer instance
where all values have absolute value at most $2^{O(n)}$. Furthermore, there
exists an instance of 3SUM where all equivalent integer instances
require numbers at least as large as the $n$th Fibonacci number and where the
standard binary representation of the instance requires $\Omega(n^2)$ bits.
