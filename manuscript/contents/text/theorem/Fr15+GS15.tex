\begin{theorem}[Freund~\cite{Fr15}, Gold~and~Sharir~\cite{GS15}]
There is a $O(n^2 \log \log n / \log n)$-time real-RAM algorithm
for 3SUM\@.%
\footnote{Chan~\cite{Ch18} shows that an additional logarithmic factor can be shaved
by augmenting the real-RAM model with constant time nonstandard operations on
$\Theta(\log n)$ bits words. His improvements extend to 3POL.}
\end{theorem}
